Baby Wants Candy (BWC) is thrilled to lead a two day music improv intensive in Switzerland. No musical improv experience needed.<!--more-->

Based on BWC's signature form- a one hour, completely improvised musical with a full band, participants will learn how to:

- Create musical narratives while still maintaining the funny

- Use the game of the scene, characters, emotions & wants to create strong comedic songs

- Rhyme confidently and consistently

- Elevate your chorus' to find the funny through dedicated word play training

Baby Wants Candy draws upon its years of experience, with over 4000 improvised musicals and counting, for its workshops. Our style combines what we consider are the best parts of UCB and io, both institutions at which we performed and taught for years.

Space is limited so sign up early.
