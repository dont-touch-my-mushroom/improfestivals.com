A whole musical being improvised in front of your eyes!

<!--more-->

Have you ever heard of Hamilton? What about Cats? Maybe Grease? Well, this is nothing like that.
We are going to develop a whole story from your suggestions. It will be full of emotions and epic songs.

We are Basic Pitches!

The money we collect from this show will be donated to [Nova Ukraine](https://novaukraine.org/), a
nonprofit organization  providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
