Moth & Butterfly International Festival of Storytelling & Improvisation is an Arts festival based in Galway in the West of Ireland. Our first festival was in 2021 and was presented digitally, in 2022 was hybrid with live events and the 2023 festival will be fully live from Galway, while retaining digital content for our international audiences. The festival will feature shows, workshops, arts events, story swaps, children's events and bilingual presentations.  The festival highlights the artforms of improvisation and storytelling in all their presentations, and is particularly interested in the magical places where they intersect. The festival features local, national and international professional artists, as well as community participation. The festival is produced by Aoife Demel, with Artistic Director Órla Mc Govern, and core M & B crew members. Join our mailing list at www.mothandbutterflystories.com
