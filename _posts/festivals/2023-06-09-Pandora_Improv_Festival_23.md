#PANDORA IMPROV FESTIVAL
## 3 days of music, love and improv

Pandora is an improv experience next to the seaside in Italy.
3 days full of events, workshops, shows, partytime, good food and wine, and much more!
All the students coming in Pandora have the same program: 9 or 12 hours workshops (mandatory for everyone!), team building activities, costume parties, main stage shows, late night shows (only for the braves), food and beverage, **all inclusive**
*no sleep till Pandora!*
