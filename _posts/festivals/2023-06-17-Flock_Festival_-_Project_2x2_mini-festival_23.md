At Flock Theatre, we love working with other artists from all over the world. Katy Schutte and Chris Mead are two fantastic improvisers from the United Kingdoms: they are accomplished multi-talented artists, great teachers and brilliant performers. They are also our friends!

For this edition of our Flock Festival, we—Laura and Gael Doorneweerd-Perry—are inviting them for a week to work with us on different things:

- Giving public workshops for a week, from half-a-day to two-day long
- Performing their brilliant duo-show already existing, Hopepunk / Project 2
- Working in residency for 5 days with Laura and Gael in order to design **four brand new fully improvised shows**
- Showcasing two nights of shows—3 shows a night—the result of the work: unique and exclusive duo-shows as well as the world-renowned Project 2 and Object of Affection!

You can join in by taking workshops and joining shows, as well as meeting the fantastic Amsterdam community for this big improv feast!
