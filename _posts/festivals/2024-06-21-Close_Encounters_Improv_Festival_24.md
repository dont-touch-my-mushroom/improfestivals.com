We are thrilled to be planning this festival that we hope will happen every year from 2024-infinity! The purpose of the festival is to celebrate improv and artists and to unite artists from all over Switzerland and eventually the world! We also want to have a lot of fun and parties! :) The theme will be 80â€™s inspired and our first festival is entitled BACK to the FUTURE! 
Stay tuned!
