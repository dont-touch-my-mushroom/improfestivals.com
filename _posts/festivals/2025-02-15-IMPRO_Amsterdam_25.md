## IMPRO Amsterdam, one of Europe's biggest and longest running English-language improv festivals, is turning 30!

For eight days in February, IMPRO Amsterdam celebrates the breadth and diversity of not just what improv is, but what it can be - comedic, dramatic, abstract, experimental, lyrical, musical, physical, cozy, boundary-breaking, and everything in between. Come for the workshops, the shows, and the community; leave with your improv horizons permanently broadened.

### Featuring:
* Several dozen shows and over fifty workshops featuring expert performers and teachers from five continents, as well as the best of the Netherlands
* A community centre where you can meet and play with over 150 improvisers from the Netherlands and around the world
* A leadership forum for theatre owners, producers, teachers, and organisers
* Some secret birthday surprises...

Stay up to date on the festival by visiting [our website](https://www.impro-amsterdam.nl) and signing up for our mailing list.
