Improfest is the annual, international, inspirational, improvisational, dramational event where Mixed and United have invited impro groups from Belgium and the UK and, most importantly, YOU for three nights of laughter, tears and everything in between. The festival also includes workshops during the day, including stand-up comedy, physical theatre and impro fundamentals.
