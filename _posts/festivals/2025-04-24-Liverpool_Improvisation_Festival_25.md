LiF â€‹encourages innovation, risk taking and are inspired by those that do. The festival aims to create opportunity for those who create and teach improvised live performance at whatever stage of their career and across multiple art forms. In doing so we aim to educate, inspire and develop future audiences and performers of improvisation. 

We aim to produce a varied programme which is representative of the broad spectrum of improvised performance and community. This means we programme short and long form and work from new / emerging  artists / companies as well as those who are more established. We especially welcome applications from artists and companies who create work that is designed for children.
