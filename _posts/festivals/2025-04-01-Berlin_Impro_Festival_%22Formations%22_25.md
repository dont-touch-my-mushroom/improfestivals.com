This year’s festival is dedicated to the exploration of techniques, tools and approaches. We will create two brand new improvised formats during the festival-week and 
our wish and proposal is, that these formats will be taken and used by anyone who participated, joined or just watched shows during our festival.

 We have an amazing cast of improvisers who will direct wonderful shows and give some  specifically curated workshops.
