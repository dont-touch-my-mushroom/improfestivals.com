Back for a sixth edition, this beloved improv festival takes place in the heart of Scotland's beautiful capital city, Edinburgh.

It's four days of workshops, shows and late night jams. This year's headliners are **Holy Shit Improv's Casey Feigh**, **Suzi Barrett** and **Ronnie Adrian**, and **World's Greatest Improv School's Will Hines**, **Sarah Claspell** and **Jim Woods**. 

Joining them are long time UCB performers and teachers **Monika Smith** and **Billy Merritt** coaching this year's Ensemble team.

This is a celebration of all things long form improv you won't want to miss.
