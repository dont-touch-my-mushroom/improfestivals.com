Improvizza! is a theatrical improvisation festival held in Malta, bringing together improvisers from all over the world to take workshops, play in jams, perform in showcases, watch shows and foster an improvisation community. Taking place on a tiny island in the middle of the Mediterranean, it offers a wonderful cultural, historical and artistic experience.
