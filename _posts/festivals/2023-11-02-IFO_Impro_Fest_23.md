In March 2020, at the very beginning of the pandemic, Impro Fest Online started as the first digital festival for improvised theatre. Created in times of crisis, through the collaboration of actors from all over Germany and Austria, the IFO is a project from the community for the community. After more than 250 online workshops, our IFO landed in Bielefeld for the first time in October 2021 and celebrated a successful second offline edition in November 2022.
