After a hugely success inaugural event last year, The Bristol Improv Theatre are delighted to announce the return of The Little Improv Festival for 2024! Join us on Friday 22nd March for the festival launch, followed by an all day festival on 23rd March.

Expect exciting entertainment from Bristolâ€™s best improvisers, a chance or two to give improv a go yourself, a warm welcome in our cosy bar between shows and lots more from the friendliest theatre in town!
