After a smashing success in 2022 we are happy to be back in 2023 with even more shows and workshops.

**This year we have a selection of:**
- 11 ensemble-members (10 actors and actresses and 1 musician)

We are very excited to have a put together a program of very different improvised styles that are represented in unique shows and workshops but at the same time to keep the spirit of a "cozy festival for friends".

We are looking forward to having you back or welcoming you for a first time in Karlsruhe!
