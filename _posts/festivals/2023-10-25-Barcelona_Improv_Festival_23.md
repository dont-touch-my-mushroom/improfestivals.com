The Barcelona Improv Festival is an annual celebration of European and worldwide improv, bringing together hundreds of improvisers from around the world to play, learn, and mix creatives from different cultures with diverse approaches to our art form. The festival is a mix of workshops during the day, performances by invited teams and mixer teams at night, and social events throughout the week.
