The ImproEM will be a European Improv Theater Championship with several matches in Munich (Germany) over four weeks in April/May 2024. Of 54 eligible European countries, we will select 18 teams to represent their nation and compete for the finals. 

Application for mixed teams of three professional improv players for these paid gigs (incl. accommodation and transport) are open through September 2023. We are looking forward to welcoming the European Improv Community in Munich!

Applicants should hold a passport of the nation they seek to represent at the games. Please visit our website for all details.
