This festival will be a full weekend of musical improv comedy joy! We've gathered four amazing teachers to come to Edinburgh and teach you the skills you'll need to have the best possible time performing completely improvised musical comedy as part of short form, in your normal improv shows, or as a fully improvised musical.

We will have a huge range of musical class topics, as well as classes about core improv skills (no singing required!). Each class will be limited to max 16 people so you will get plenty of time practicing in each class and lots of individual feedback from your teachers. We will also have amazing shows and jams every night.
