¡Buena Onda - International Improvisational Theater Festival!

Bogotá vibrates with this grand celebration of improvisation. Enjoy a fantastic collection of diverse shows. We will start with Maestro™, a classic format perfect for inaugurating this celebration, where 14 improvisers compete to become the winner of the night. Then, we immerse ourselves in a format where a cast of women will share personal experiences. An original creation by Hila De Castro that will be presented simultaneously in different cities around the world.

Next, the group behind La Terapia will delight us with a show born from last year's New Formats Laboratory. In a double feature night, we will close with a flourish presenting Directors Cut, a competition between directors that will leave you breathless.

On Saturday, March 16, this improvisation marathon culminates with an explosive day. Two workshops led by our international guests and another double feature. The ensemble premieres Chorizo, a format of particular connections, tied by a space, and we finish the day with the fabulous Moments of Life, an original format by Patti Stiles that always takes us to fascinating places.

This year we have the presence of a great guest visiting us from Slovenia and another great colleague coming from Italy. Sara Šoukal (Ljubljana), a very important figure in international theatrical improvisation, who has been exploring clowning, street theater, contemporary dance, among others, for some time, and Andrea Lagrange (Rome), a passionate improviser and teacher who seeks to develop an expressive body language and create captivating relationships.
