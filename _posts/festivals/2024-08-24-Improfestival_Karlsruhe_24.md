After a smashing success in the last few years we are happy to be back in 2024 with even more shows and workshops.

**This year we have a selection of:**
- 12 ensemble-members (10 actors, 1 musician and 1 technician)
- A total of 9 days workshops, including one 3-day workshop with a showcase
- And 18 completely different shows over 6 nights of performances

We are very excited to have a put together a program of very different improvised styles that are represented in unique shows and workshops but at the same time to keep the spirit of a "cozy festival for friends".

We are looking forward to having you back or welcoming you for a first time in Karlsruhe!
