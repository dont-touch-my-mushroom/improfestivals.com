We are happy to invite you to the 6-th International Sofia Improv Festival. 
20-24 September 2023, Sofia, Bulgaria

**GENRES** is the topic of this year's festival. Join us in celebrating improv!
Four groups will perform four different improv shows in distinct genres. The performers will be teaching master classes in the respective genres 
during the festival. Additional workshops will be available for honing your improv skills. There will be lots of performance opportunities on our beautiful theatrical stage. 
Fun afterparties will shake our bar at the dedicated ShiZi Improv Club. 
Come meet one of the friendliest improv communities in Europe!

An optional hiking day to the beautiful Vitosha mountain just half hour away from the city.
