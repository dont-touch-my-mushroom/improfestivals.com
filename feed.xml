&lt;p&gt;Bogotá vibrates with this grand celebration of improvisation. Enjoy a fantastic collection of diverse shows. We will start with Maestro™, a classic format perfect for inaugurating this celebration, where 14 improvisers compete to become the winner of the night. Then, we immerse ourselves in a format where a cast of women will share personal experiences. An original creation by Hila De Castro that will be presented simultaneously in different cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the group behind La Terapia will delight us with a show born from last year’s New Formats Laboratory. In a double feature night, we will close with a flourish presenting Directors Cut, a competition between directors that will leave you breathless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, March 16, this improvisation marathon culminates with an explosive day. Two workshops led by our international guests and another double feature. The ensemble premieres Chorizo, a format of particular connections, tied by a space, and we finish the day with the fabulous Moments of Life, an original format by Patti Stiles that always takes us to fascinating places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we have the presence of a great guest visiting us from Slovenia and another great colleague coming from Italy. Sara Šoukal (Ljubljana), a very important figure in international theatrical improvisation, who has been exploring clowning, street theater, contemporary dance, among others, for some time, and Andrea Lagrange (Rome), a passionate improviser and teacher who seeks to develop an expressive body language and create captivating relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">¡Buena Onda - International Improvisational Theater Festival!
