                <title>IFO Impro Fest</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, at the very beginning of the pandemic, Impro Fest Online started as the first digital festival for improvised theatre. Created in times of crisis, through the collaboration of actors from all over Germany and Austria, the IFO is a project from the community for the community. After more than 250 online workshops, our IFO landed in Bielefeld for the first time in October 2021 and celebrated a successful second offline edition in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>IRREVERENTE</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The Festival intends to bring together the impro community living in Portugal with other countries, by promoting an event with activities in Theater, Dance, Music and other forms of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our irreverence seeks to break preconceived concepts, about the art of improvisation and the art that is created in contemporaneity, questioning and reaffirming, and mainly, breaking with the idea that differences distance us. Saying “Yes, and”, the motto of improvisation. “Yes” for us and other people, “and” create together something that finds its own new rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Mission: Deconstruct judgments and preconceptions about art, ourselves and about the art we make, in order to find out authenticity at the rhythm of the Tejo river waves.&lt;/p&gt;
