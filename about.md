**Improfestivals.com** is a personal project to be able to keep track of all the 
impro festivals.

I love impro and I love attending festivals. However, it's quite hard to keep
track of all of them and I would unfortunately miss good ones.

If you are organizing a festival and you want it listed here please fill up
<a href="{{site.festivals-form}}" target="_blank"> this form</a>.

Please read the instuctions carefully.
